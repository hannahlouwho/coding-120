      <p style="text-align:center;">About Me!</p>

      <p style="text-align:center;">Hello, I'm Hannah Banana, Fee Fi Fo Fana... something like that!
      â€‹

      Who am I? I am your every day kitty loving, bubbly blonde, explorer, mixed with sugar, spice,
      and something nice on the rocks.



      I grew up in Big Timber Montana. Where the Crazy Mountains are and the friendly people grow.
      Coming from a small town has taught me two very important lessons. Do good and good will follow you,
      and there is no place like Montana.

      Poseidon Designs is a metaphor I created to represent my journey with wedding design. When deciding
      on my brand name I didn't want to go the traditional route that every other designer has. I thought
      about my life and what has led me to this point. My thoughts brought me to my small town. Since I was
      little I always knew that I wanted to leave and do big things with my life. I had been staring at the
      edge of a metaphorical cliff my entire life, but I never really knew what was out there for me.

      Coming from a small town, the idea of "dreaming big" wasn't something people did. You graduated high
      school, took over the family business, got married, had kids, and then grew old. The idea of knowing
      where my life was going was not something that I wanted. In result, I always came back to the cliff
      of my possibilities. I tried to go the traditional route that everyone said would make me happy one
      day and in all honesty I was scared to go to the cliff and see what was there for me. Going to college
      and starting a career far away from home was terrifying. However the idea of staying still in my small
      town scared me more. As time went on the pull to the cliff grew stronger.

      One day I decided I wanted more than this provincial life #BeautyandtheBeast. I stood at the edge of
      my cliff of possibility and thats when I saw a beautiful ocean of opportunity. I knew I had to see what
      was out there, I had to jump, and I had to see how far I could go. As I plunged into the ocean of freedom
      I saw clearly where I wanted my life to go and who I wanted to be. So, I found a boat (University of Montana),
      climbed aboard, set my sails to the wind and started my degrees in Media Arts and Event Planning.

      Poseidon Designs is a mission. A mission to make everlasting memories. I strive to capture hearts, emotions,
      and the culture that everyone possesses. All while building a lifelong relationship with everyone I have the
      pleasure of meeting. I am excited to meet new friends and create bonds that I can forever carry with me. SO
      LETS DO THIS THING!</p>
