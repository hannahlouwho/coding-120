#Homework #3

I scored high on the Grit Scale, I believe it is a little higher than what is probably accurate. But it may also be lower than what is accurate. My entire life has been about rising above and moving forward no matter what happens. Sometimes I feel like I'm just in survival mode 24/7. I was not surprised by my results but I also did not exactly really realise what choices I make every day and that they have to do with grit.

Last year was honestly the hardest year of my life. I survived an abusive relationship with a guy that attended the university so I rarely came to class because I never felt safe. I even changed my residence and my car so he would not be able to find me very easily. I lost my best friend to suicide. Then, I completely lost my drive. I no longer wanted to go to school, work, or even get out of bed in the morning. I wanted to give up entirely. Honestly, if I wouldn’t have been the leaseholder on my apartment where my roommate was 100% dependent on my ability to pay my half of the bills, and a mom to a kitty I may have given up. But I knew that I could not give up. I had a degree to finish, a promotion at work that I wanted, a kitty to take care of, and an intense desire to prove that my obstacles couldn’t destroy me like they had been.

So, I pushed forward and told myself that if I kept my head down and kept going it was going to be okay one day. And I am right, I am okay again.
